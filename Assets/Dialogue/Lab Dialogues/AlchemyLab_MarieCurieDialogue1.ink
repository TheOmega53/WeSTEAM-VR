Hello! I'm Marie Curie, left alone and focused on my studies for the past years. 
I feel like there's so much potential in these chemicals, we already know they emit some radioactive waves but...
Nobody knows how it happens or why it happens. I'm trying to see if the physical charasteristics of the chemical are the reason for the radio waves. Do you want to help?

I've already crushed some of the elements with the mortar and pestle, see if you can pour the stuff from the mortar into the blue bottle next to it.
