That's perfect!
Although it doesn't look like there is still any change on the amount of radio waves emitted...
But no worries! that in itself is a valueable lesson!

It means that physical changes don't affect radio activity!

Thanks for helping me out on my experiments! Although I still have many more experiments to run..
