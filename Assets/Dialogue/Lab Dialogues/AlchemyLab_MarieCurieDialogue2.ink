Nicely done!

Hmm.. looks like even after crushing it there is still radiation.

We can't be sure.. I have another experiment planned as well

Do you see the red bottle on the table? that's already filled with radiowave emitting materials. maybe if we try to heat them up the amount of radiation will change?

Try putting it on top of the candle. don't worry, it won't break.
