Now you have the knowledge to repair the components required for the warp system!

I have already repaired the base part of the warp core, the improbability module.

You can go ahead and give the schema of the things you learned to the 3D hyperdrive printing modules on the right and left side of the room.

The 3D hyperdrive modules are quite smart, so as long as you give them a generally good schema they'll understand what is required for the ship!

Good luck!
